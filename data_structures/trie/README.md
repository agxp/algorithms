# Basics
- A trie is a data structure very similar to a heap (but can be implemented in other ways)
- It stores a priority along with every item instead of comparing the data directly (unlike a min or max-heap)
- insert O(logn)
- get highest priority item O(1)
- delete highest priority item O(logn)
